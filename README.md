# Forklift

A forklift sim game.

In this game, you write an AI to control a robot forklift and deliver packages.

## Getting started

### Prereqs

You will need to install a few things to get this working.

* an editor (I recommend Intellij Community)
* a git client - we use this to share code.
* a JDK (intellij can install this for you, or we can manually set it up)

### Getting running

Make a local copy of the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stewsters/forklift.git
```

Then open it in intellij. It will download the dependencies which will take a minute or two.
To run it open the gradle window on the right side, and hit tasks>application>run

If it works, you should see some forklifts driving.
